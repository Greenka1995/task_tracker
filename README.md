# Task tracker
Planning to create an app to keep track of planned task and how much time has been spent on them :3

# General idea
  Lets say we have a goal to pursue, like "Studying C++". Then it should be possible to create this task in the app and should have such functionality:
 * track overall time spent on the task;
 * track dates that work has been done on the task (preferably in calendar format for easy visualisation);
 * track time spent on every individual day;
 * be able to set a goal of hours a day or overall hours to be spent on every individual task;
 * be able to create a shedule for a day and be able to set notifications to remind on specified time;
 * be able to start performing the task, to start a timer, pause, continue and stop;
 * be able to add comments on every instance of task performed.
 * be able to do analysis of data (time spent on tasks in graphs maybe and productivity grade, etc.)

App will be developed using C++ and for interface OpenGL, on PC at least, also console application will be available.

# Possible features
  Additional functionality for further updates:
 * being able to add subtasks;
 * custom formating for popular tasks, like sport, studying, etc.;
 * being able to synchronize progress on different platforms (PC (Windows, Linux, maybe Mac*), Phone (Android, maybe IOS*)).

# Goal
  I created this project to study C++ on an example of a real app and maybe to use it at the same time. Hope it is sufficient complexity to be included in the portfollio.

# What is accomplished for now
  A functioning console application that is able to document: 
  * tasks (task name, task description, task goal, task completion);
  * calendar of progress (dates(sessions during that day(task, time spent during session, start and end time, time during pause))).
  For the display of data its capable of showing tasks and all data associated with it as well as detailed info for each day.
