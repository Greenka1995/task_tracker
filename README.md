# task_tracker
Planning to create an app to keep track of planned task and how much time has been spent on them :3

# General idea
  Lets say we have a goal to pursue, like "Studying C++". Then it should be possible to create this task in the app and should have such functionality:
 * track overall time spent on the task;
 * track dates that work has been done on the task (preferably in calendar format for easy visualisation);
 * track time spent on every individual day;
 * be able to set a goal of hours a day or overall hours to be spent on every individual task;
 * be able to create a shedule for a day and be able to set notifications to remind on specified time;
 * be able to start performing the task, to start a timer, pause, continue and stop;
 * be able to add comments on every instance of task performed.
  App will be developed using C++ and for interface OpenGL, on PC at least.

# Possible features
  Additional functionality for further updates:
 * being able to add subtasks;
 * custom formating for popular tasks, like sport, studying, etc.;
 * being able to synchronize progress on different platforms (PC (Windows, Linux, maybe Mac*), Phone (Android, maybe IOS*)).

# Goal
  I created this project to study C++ on an example of a real app and maybe to use it at the same time. Hope it is sufficient complexity to be included in the portfollio.
